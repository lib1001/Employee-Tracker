## Description:

This application allows users to view, add, and edit employee information.

## Installation:

inquirer, mysql2, console.table

## Usage:

The user begins by typing node index.js into the terminal. The user is then prompted to select if they would like to view, add or update the departments, roles, or employees. When the user selects to view an item, the table containing that information will appear in the terminal. When adding or updating information, the user will be prompted by questions regarding that category, and they will type their answers, pressing enter when finished. Once the user is finished doing everything they want to do, they can select "I'm done!" to exit the application.
